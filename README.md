# Escaping Fame
A game about running from fans and trying to get away from awkward situations. Everything was made by a group of five in two days. Lots of bugs and lots of things that were never finished.
Päivölä Hackathon 5/2023.

## Installation
Install python requirements. Note requirest python3
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
Run main.py
`python main.py`

## Implemented
- Map and smooth movement
- Fight encounters against fans
- Stress- and timebar
- Cars :)
- 3/4 endings are working
- A bunch of beautiful models

## TODO
- Encounter texts aren't mapped correctly
- Fans can be easily avoided
- Cars are too brutal
- Better level design / endboss?
- Code gets messier with passing time
- Bugs.
